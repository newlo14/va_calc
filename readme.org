OK, so I've written a really basic terminal program that calculates the VA disability values, does the "VA math".

It takes a set of inputs and calculates a disability rating based on the official [[https://www.va.gov/VA-combined-ratings-table-2019.pdf][combined ratings table from Veterans Affairs (2019)]].

Feel free to use the program with additional *arbitrary* values.

* Prerequisites
>  Install python (version 3.5 or higher) from [[https://www.python.org/][python.org]]

>  Download and extract the /va.py/ file from this repository using the green "Code" button above.
* Usage
** Example Video
In the short [[https://youtu.be/dRkSsFrLmCw][example_video]], I've already downloaded python on a Windows machine.

It shows the basic usage which is also explained here below.
